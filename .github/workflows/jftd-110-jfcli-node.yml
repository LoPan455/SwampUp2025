      # the OIDC authentication was successful and that the JFrog CLI setup step
      # properly generated an access token. It only runs when the setup-jfrog-cli
      # step successfully outputs an OIDC token, providing immediate feedback on
      # the authentication status before proceeding with subsequent operations.
      #
      # Why it's important: This step helps troubleshoot OIDC integration issues
      # early in the workflow and confirms that the JFrog CLI is properly configured
      # with valid credentials before attempting to use it for npm operations.
