# Lab 1: OSS Filtering using Curated Remote Repo
This lab walks you through configuring and using JFrog Curation to block unwanted open-source software (OSS) packages from entering your software supply chain. You'll set up a policy to block all packages by default and then create a manual waiver process for developers to request exceptions.

## Prerequisites
- Before you start, make sure you have the following ready:
- JFrog CLI: Installed and configured in your shell's PATH.
- JFrog Platform Access: You'll need the URL and login credentials for your JFrog instance.
- `jq` The command-line JSON processor must be installed.
- Lab Files: You should have the lab scripts checked out locally.
- JFrog Platform UI credentials
    - username: ``` admin ```
    - Password: ``` Admin1234! ```
## Setup and Configuration
First, let's set up the necessary repositories using a script.

### Navigate to the Lab Directory
Open your terminal or IDE's built-in terminal and change to the lab directory.
```
cd ~/jfrog/JFTD-114-Compliant_SDLC_Without_Compromise/LAB-1
```

### Create Repositories
Run the setup script to automatically create three remote repositories (for Maven, PyPI, and NPM) in Artifactory. The script adds a timestamp to the repository names to ensure they are unique.
````
    ./setup-repos.sh
````
This script will create the remote, local, and virtual repositories needed for the lab.

## Curation Policy Setup
Now, let's configure the curation policy in the JFrog Platform UI.

### Enable Curation
- Next, you need to enable the Curation service for the repositories.
- Navigate to **Administration** >> **Curation Settings**.
- Toggle the switch to **Enable Curation**.

- Next, click on to enable Enable repositories

- From the list of repositories, toggle the remote repositories you created with the `setup-repos.sh` script to enable curation on them.

### Create a Labels
Labels are used to tag packages, and we'll use one to identify packages that are approved for use.

- Navigate to **Platform** >> **Catalog** >> **Labels**.
- Click the **Create New Label** button.

- Enter the following details:
    - Label Name: ` ALLOW-THIS `
    - Description: ` ALLOW PACKAGES  `

- Enter the following details:
    - Label Name: ` SADMIN-ALLOW `
    - Description: ` Allowed by Security Admin for Demo purpose only  `

- Click **Save Label**.



### Create a Curation Condition
The condition defines the logic for our policy. Here, we'll create a condition to block everything unless it's explicitly allowed.

- Navigate to **Administration** >> **Curation Settings** and select the Conditions tab.
- Click **Create Condition.**
- Select the Custom conditions templates tab and choose `Block package unless it has a label in allowed labels list`.
- Fill in the fields:
    - Condition Name: ` DEFAULT-BLOCK-ALL `
    - Allowed Label: ` ALLOW-THIS ` (Select from the dropdown)
- Click **Save Condition**.

### Create a Curation Policy
Finally, assemble the components into a policy that applies to a specific repository.

- Navigate to **Administration** >> **Curation Settings** and select the General tab.
- Click **Create policy** and enter the following details:
    - Policy Name: `curation-blocked-remote`
    - Scope: Select **Specific remote repositories** and choose the `pypi-remote` repository created by the script.

    - Policy Condition: Select `DEFAULT-BLOCK-ALL` from the dropdown.

    <img src="./images/curation-policy-condition.png" /> <br/>

    - Waiver label: `SADMIN-ALLOW`
    - Justification: `Allow for Swampup Lab`

    <img src="./images/curation-policy-waiver.png" /> <br/>

    - Actions & Notification:
        - Action: `Choose Block`.
        - Waiver Request: `Set to Manual approved`.
        - Owner Groups: `sup-admin (or another appropriate admin group)`.
        - **Save** the policy.


## Developer: Auditing a Requesting a Waiver
The developer uses the `jf ca` command to check if their app dependencies violate any Curation policies before attempting to download them.

```
cd py-app
```

- Configure the project's repository: In the project directory, configure the JFrog CLI to use the virtual repository you created. For a PyPI project, this would be:

```
jf pipc --repo-resolve='pypi-remote'
```

- Run the Curation Audit: Execute the curation-audit command to scan the project.

```
jf ca --requirements-file=requirements.txt --format=table --threads=100
```

The output will show that the package is blocked by the 'blocked-pypi-remote' policy. Because the policy is configured to allow manual waivers, the developer is prompted to request one.

- Request the Waiver: The developer follows the interactive prompts in the CLI to select the package and provide a justification for the waiver.

## Approver: Reviewing and Approving the Waiver
The designated approver (a member of the sup-admin group) manages the request in the JFrog Platform.

- The approver receives a notification and navigates to the waiver management interface to see the pending request.
- They can review the package details, the developer's justification, and the policies that are blocking it.
- Upon approval, the ALLOW-THIS label is automatically applied to the package in the Catalog, making it available for download.

After approval, the developer can successfully resolve and download the dependency into their project. ðŸŽ‰
